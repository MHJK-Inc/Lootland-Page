            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Lootland: Treasure into Sea is a top-down survival exploration game that plunges players into a thrilling
              adventure to find hidden treasures and artifacts. A treasure hunter on a quest to uncover the secrets of
              Atlantis, players must survive waves of increasingly strong enemies while maintaining their air capacity.
            </p>
            <p>Air can be lost through enemy attacks or over time, but it can also be gained by exploring the map or
              defeating enemies. The game features innovative objectives that incentivize players to explore the map,
              including collecting items and closing gates guarded by stronger enemies to earn extra treasure. As the
              waves progress, the game becomes more challenging, requiring players to use strategy and quick reflexes to
              survive.</p>
